/*
usage of break;

if you put break under a condition in any loop
    you are just saying;
        if the condition above is true;
            break the loop, and exit it. dont execute any comment after it.

usage of continue;
    as like above, if the condition above the continue is true;
        dont break the loop, BUT, end the current iteration, and start next one. continue to loop.
